          This is an alert meant to ensure that the entire alerting pipeline is functional.
          This alert is always firing, therefore it should always be firing in Alertmanager
          and always fire against a receiver.  We use cronitor to alert us if this ever
          does not fire, because this indicates a problem with our alerting pipeline
