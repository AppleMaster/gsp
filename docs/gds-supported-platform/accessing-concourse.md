# Accessing Concourse

You use [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org) to build, test and deploy apps on the GDS Supported Platform (GSP). You can access Concourse through either the [`fly` CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) or through a browser.

## Accessing Concourse using `fly`

To access Concourse using [`fly`](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html), your version of `fly` must match your version of Concourse.

Visit your Concourse to check your `fly` version. Use the links in the bottom right of your Concourse page to upgrade your `fly` if necessary. You can find an example Concourse at http://ci.london.verify.govsvc.uk/.

Refer to the [`fly` documentation](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) for more information on accessing Concourse using `fly`.
